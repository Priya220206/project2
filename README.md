# Predictive Maintenance  
**Project Title:** Predicting Failure in Machines
Welcome to the *Machine Failure Predictor Web App*!  
This interactive Streamlit app estimates the failure in machine based on key features like torque, temperature, rotational speed, and more.
> *Note:* This is a personal learning project and is not suitable for real-world commercial use.

## 📝 Project Description  
In heavy duty industrial environments, unplanned downtime impacts both productivity and profitability.
FleetGuard AI continuously monitors vital parameters : temperature, rotational speed, torque—to detect abnormalities before they become failures.
Powered by an ensemble of Random Forest classifiers, the system captures subtle deviations across sensor streams and votes on risk levels,offering a reliable, real-time prediction of equipment health.
By relying on condition based insights rather than purely scheduled servicing—your maintenance becomes smarter.
You'll save costs, lengthen machinery lifespan, and boost safety.

### **Objectives**
To understand the key factors causing failure in machines to increase the lifesapn of machines and for better working.
Key Factors are:
🌡️🔥Temperature
⚙️🔃Rotational Speed
🔧⚙️Torque
Machine Learning models can detect subtle patterns that signal impending faults.
