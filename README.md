# Predictive Maintenance  
**Project Title:** Predicting Failure in Machines
Welcome to the *Machine Failure Predictor Web App*!  
This interactive Streamlit app estimates the failure in machine based on key features like torque, temperature, rotational speed, and more.
> *Note:* This is a personal learning project and is not suitable for real-world commercial use.

## 📝 Project Description  
This project aims to understand key factors influencing mental health among tech employees and build data-driven solutions for improving workplace well-being. It uses machine learning techniques to perform classification, regression, and clustering tasks and presents results via an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

### **Objectives**
To understand the key factors influencing mental health issues among employees in the tech industry and
build data-driven solutions for:
- **Classification Task:** Predict whether an individual is likely to seek mental health treatment.
- **Regression Task:** Predict the age of an individual based on personal and workplace attributes, supporting age-targeted intervention design.
- **Unsupervised Task:** Segment tech employees into distinct clusters based on mental health indicators to aid in tailored HR policies
